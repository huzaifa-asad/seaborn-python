# Seaborn Python Library

Seaborn is a powerful Python visualization library based on matplotlib. This project demonstrates how to use Seaborn for basic, advanced, and customized plots, as well as how to integrate it with Pandas DataFrames. The included scripts and Jupyter notebook are designed for data scientists, analysts, and anyone interested in data visualization.

## Features

- Ready-to-use scripts for basic, advanced, and customized Seaborn plots
- Examples of Seaborn with Pandas DataFrames
- Interactive Jupyter notebook (`seaplots.ipynb`)
- Follows PEP8 style guidelines
